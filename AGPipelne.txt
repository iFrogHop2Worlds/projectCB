save components of objects in different part objects. 

EXAMPLE:
AllureTrends collection		-we will use different collections for each category
[
	images [
	i1: 3fsse
	i2: 3fsse
	i3: 3fsse
	]
	titles [
	t1: 3fsse
	t2: 3fsse
	t3: 3fsse
	]
	content [
	c1: ththrthw54
	c2: hwrhwrthwrtrth
	c3: hertherther
	]
	links [
	l1: <links>
	l2: <links>
	l3: <links>
	]
	date?[...]
	author[...]
]


Now we can run it through aggregation pipelines and format however we want

{match i1} -> {project i1}
{match t1} -> {project t1}
{match c1} -> {project c1}
{match l1} -> {project l1}
{match d1} -> {project d1}
{match auth1} -> {project auth1}
would output

<img>
<title>
<content>
<date>
<author>
<link>
