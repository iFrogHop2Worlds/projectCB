save components of objects in different part objects. 

EXAMPLE:
AllureTrends collection		-we will use different collections for each category
[
	images
	[
	i1: 3fsse,
	i2: 3fsse
	i3: 3fsse
	]
	titles
	[
	t1: 3fsse,
	t2: 3fsse
	t3: 3fsse
	]
	content
	[
	c1: ththrthw54,
	c2: hwrhwrthwrtrth
	c3: hertherther
	]
]


Now we can run it through aggregation pipelines and format however we want

{match i1} -> {project i1}
{match t1} -> {project t1}
{match c1} -> {project c1}

would output

<img>
<title>
<data>
