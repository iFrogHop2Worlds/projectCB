# projectCB

to get started open a terminal in a folder where you want to keep the project

1) type or copy and paste -> git init 
2) type or copy and paste -> git clone https://github.com/iFrogHop2Worlds/projectCB.git

(if either of these commands throws an error you prob need to downlaod and install git https://git-scm.com/downloads)

3) type or copy and paste -> cd projectCB
4) to open in vscode now type or copy and paste -> code . (dont miss that period)

thats it for now. happy hacking!
